# Progressive Web App Series

All PWA demo projects build here will have each one built in its seperate branch.

All projects will branch off from the `main` branch.

The `main` branch is a scaffold with the following installed packages
 - Vue 3
 - Tailwind CSS
 - Lint and Prettier

### Notes
1. Every other project will have their unique packages installed on their respective branches.
2. Set up PWA installation independently for each project on their respective branch.
3. DO NOT MERGE ANY PROJECT/BRANCH TO THE MAIN BRANCH!!! THe main branch is solely for scaffolding!
